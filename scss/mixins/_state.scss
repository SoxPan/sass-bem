/**
 * Signify that the piece of UI in question 
 * is currently styled a certain way because 
 * of a state or condition. This stateful 
 * namespace is gorgeous, and comes from SMACSS. 
 * It tells us that the DOM currently has a 
 * temporary, optional, or short-lived style 
 * applied to it due to a certain state being invoked.
 *
 * -----
 *
 * Signify that this piece of the DOM has some 
 * behaviour acting upon it, and that JavaScript 
 * binds onto it to provide that behaviour. 
 * If youâ€™re not a developer working with 
 * JavaScript, leave these well alone.
